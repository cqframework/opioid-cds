  Trigger context:
  	Primary care/ambulatory care
  Trigger event:
    Prescription of opioid with ambulatory care abuse potential
  Assumptions:
    Count only ambulatory prescriptions
  Inclusion criteria (OR):
    Average MME >= 50
    On benzodiazepine
    History of alcohol abuse or drug abuse (in FHIR Condition, which means problem list at this point for many EHRs.  Univ. of Utah has created separate interfaces for pulling in past medical history and encounter diagnosis, but this will not be widely available)
  Exclusion criterion:
    On naloxone
  Notification:
    Consider offering naloxone given following risk factor(s) for opioid overdose: (average MME >= 50/day), (concurrent use of benzodiazepine), (history of alcohol or drug abuse).
    Ref: CDC Recommendation #8.
  Value sets:
    Custom value set for relevant substance abuse (Rob will create)
      This needs to include ICD9 and/or 10
      For now, defining value sets as descendants of:
        ICD10: F10-F19, Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use
        ICD9: 304, Drug dependence and 303, Alcohol dependence syndrome
