<p>
    Opioids for chronic pain management are often not started with an intent for chronic use; such
    prescriptions often transition from intended acute pain management. Therefore, it is very difficult
    to identify a new opioid prescription a priori as for chronic pain management.
</p>

<p>Indications and associated diagnoses for opioid prescriptions are often not available within the EHR.</p>

<p>End dates for opioid prescriptions are often not reliable.</p>

<p>The initial focus is on Epic and Cerner EHR platforms.</p>
<p>
    The technical framework to be used for EHR integration is CDS Hooks, with the FHIR
    Clinical Reasoning Module to represent the behavioral artifacts.
</p>
<p>
    Widely scaling this type of CDS is still bleeding-edge clinical informatics work, so
    an iterative and agile approach is recommended.
</p>
<p>Both Epic and Cerner will be capable of supporting the provision of the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Opioid medications about to be prescribed</li>
    <li>Problem list, including for cancer</li>
    <li>Prior urine drug testing results</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The degree to which standard vocabularies are used by Epic and Cerner to provide this
    information must be verified at each implementation site, and to the extent that they are
    not uniform, terminology mappings will need to be established.

<p>
    The first issue to establish is how to determine what constitutes an opioid. The CDC guideline
    uses NDC codes derived from SAS calculations intended for use against prescription data. Prescription
    data can include ordered medication and/or dispensed medication, depending on availability at the local site.
</p>

<p>To avoid excess alerting, the algorithm uses the following exclusions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The project team considered excluding liquid opioids altogether, since they may be used for patients with 
      life-limited diseases who might be excluded from the recommendations. However, that approach would also exclude
      cough medications which have a significant abuse potential. Therefore, the team excluded only injectable liquid
      forms of opioid and retained oral formulations.</li>
    <li>In some cases, EHR vendors have developed approaches to identify MME equivalents. In such situations, the
        implementation should attempt to match the vendor's approach so that end users receive consistent advice.</li>
</ol>

<a name="terminology"> </a>
<h4><span class="sectioncount">8.2.2.2</span> Terminology <a href="process-documentation.html#terminology" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h4>

<p>
To identify opioids, the IG provides a value set containing RxNorm Semantic 
Clinical Drug (SCD) and Semantic Brand Drug (SBD) concepts which include 
ingredient(s), strength, route and dose form.  The team provides an 
enumerated (extensional) value set. However, a value set with that approach 
quickly becomes outdated as RxNorm updates frequently, or the value set must 
be updated and made available frequently. Therefore, the project team also 
includes an RxNorm query to retrieve all opioids in the 
extended-release/long-acting category and in the immediate-release category.  
Thus, each implementer can update their value sets and run the expressions 
at frequencies appropriate to the organization.  The challenge with using 
queries is that RxNorm retires concepts for medications for which there is no 
input activity (e.g., the NDC code is no longer available). Thus, the output 
of the data retrieved will not include historical drugs for which codes have 
been retired. The impact of missing retired codes for MME calculations is 
likely to be minimal to none since most opioid prescriptions have short 
durations of 30 days or less and codes should be relatively recent.  
</p>

<a name="ordered-vs-dispensed"> </a>
<h4><span class="sectioncount">8.2.2.3</span> Use of Ordered vs Dispensed Medications <a href="process-documentation.html#ordered-vs-dispensed" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h4>

<p>
Medication self-administration data are not available in the ambulatory setting, 
nor would such data be reliable. Therefore, the most proximal information about 
a patient’s medication usage is medication dispensed data. Such dispensed data 
is increasingly accessible from claims data available to insurers and used to 
evaluate provider medication utilization rates.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>  Researchers can access 
population-based dispensed data from government sources.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Some provider 
organizations also have access to dispensed data for patients treated by their 
clinicians.  The project team considered calculating morphine milligram 
equivalents (MMEs) available to a patient based on medication dispensed data. 
However, since dispensed data are not available to all provider organizations 
and since the pilot site did not have such access, the guidance in this 
implementation guide addresses medication order (prescription) data. Using 
prescription data presented an issue regarding comprehensiveness of the data 
set. While dispensed data are generally available as structured data, 
evaluation of medication order data at the pilot organization showed 20% of 
opioid prescriptions used free-text (unstructured) instructions with over 10,000
 unique patterns. Eliminating such prescriptions from the analysis could 
 introduce disproportionate impact of clinical decision support interventions. 
 The team built a parsing algorithm to create structured information from 80% 
 of the free-text instructions. Clinical review of the parsing results by two, 
 independent clinicians confirmed their accuracy. Therefore, the team included 
 the parsed data in the MME calculations.
</p>

<p>
    For geographic locations with pharmacies that participate in Surescripts, implementation sites have
    the option to use dispense data to perform the MME calculation. However, coverage varies by region,
    and even for regions with coverage, licensing costs may be required and must be considered as a factor
    when determining whether to use dispense data.
</p>

<a name="calc"> </a>
<h4><span class="sectioncount">8.2.2.4</span> Calculation of Daily Dosage <a href="process-documentation.html#calc" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h4>

<p>
    Calculation of daily dosage is based on the prescribed (order) or dispensed data based on expected use
    at the implementation site. The patient may be taking medication less often than prescribed or expected. For
    example, medication ordered every 4 hours as needed (PRN) leads to a calculation of six doses within a 24 hour
    period.
</p>

<p>The daily dosage calculation is different based on whether dispsensed data is used:</p>

<p><strong>Order Data (total daily dose based on the sig)</strong></p>

<p>Expected use: Total daily dose = quantity per use * strength * daily frequency</p>

<p>Example: Order for two 24 mg tabs every 4 hours = 2 * 24 mg * 6 = 300 mg per day</p>

<p><strong>Dispensed Data (dose not use sig)</strong></p>

<p>Expected use: Total daily dose = (number dispensed * strength) / duration (days)</p>

<p>Example: Dispensed 60 pills, 25 mg each, for 30 days = (60 * 25) / 30, or 50 mg per day</p>

<p>
    Actual use may be less per day for a longer time period for either calculation, but the MME calculation addresses
    the prescribed or dispensed data. It is also possible that patients received dispensed medication and failed to
    ingest some or all of it. The extent to which differences exist between actual use and ordered or dispensed data requires
    access to reconciled medication data and may be confounded by trust issues.
</p>

<p>
    The National Comittee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
    took a similar approach to determining cumulative medication use over time. The related electronic clinical quality
    measure (eCQM) CMS 128 addresses continuous use of anti-depressant medication management as 84 to 114 days (short term) and
    180 to 231 days (long term) based on active medication and can use prescribed or dispensed data as they are available.
    The eCQM assumes the medication is dispensed and used as written.

<p>
    Active medications in an EHR may have a start date and indicate the number of doses written; however,
    if not discontinued, the algorithm assumes the ordered medication remains active.
</p>

<p>The logic assumes the prescription is filled on the day of the order.</p>

<p>If the prescription includes refills, the system assumes the patient requested all refills of the medication.</p>

<a name="tolerant-vs-naive"> </a>
<h4><span class="sectioncount">8.2.2.6</span> Opioid-tolerant vs Opioid-naive <a href="process-documentation.html#tolerant-vs-naive" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h4>

<p>
The team considered how to define the concepts opioid-tolerant and opioid-naïve. 
Guidelines for pain management in adult cancer pain defined these terms as:<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
<p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Opioid tolerant:</b> patients who are taking, for 1 week or longer, at least:
    <ul>
      <li>60 mg oral morphine/day;</li>
      <li>25 µg transdermal fentanyl/hour;</li>
      <li>30 mg oral oxycodone/day;</li>
      <li>8 mg oral hydromorphone/day;</li>
      <li>25 mg oral oxymorphone/day; or</li>
      <li>An equianalgesic dose of any other opioid.</li>
    </ul></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Opioid naive:</b> patients who do not meet the above definition of
     opioid tolerant, and who have not taken opioid doses at least as much as
      those listed above for 1 week or longer.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The NCCN v.2010 pain management algorithms also supply simpler definitions for these terms:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Opioid naive:</b> patients who are not chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis; and</li>
        <li><b>Opioid tolerant:</b> patients who are chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis.</li>
      </ul>
</p>

<p>
The team was concerned that an opioid-naïve patient by the definitions provided 
could have received opioid prescriptions and potentially have an MME of greater 
than 50.  Informing a physician that a patient with an elevated MME is opioid 
naïve would lead to confusion. Therefore, the team decided to base 
recommendations on the MME calculation and to avoid categorizing patients as 
opioid tolerant or naïve.
</p>

<a name="opioid-abuse-assessment"> </a>
<h4><span class="sectioncount">8.2.2.7</span> Opioid Abuse Risk Assessment <a href="process-documentation.html#opioid-abuse-assessment" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h4>

<p>The project team considered options to determine that a provider has evaluated 
  benefits and harms of opioid use.  The implementer needs to determine how the 
  local clinicians capture such assessments and map the concept to the SNOMED-CT 
  concept: <i>Assessment of risk for opioid abuse (procedure) SCTID: 454281000124100</i>
</p>

<p>The team rejected use of the concept <i>At risk for drug therapy problem (finding) (SCTID: 451691000124102)</i>
 as it was too generic as it could address non-opioid medication therapy concerns. 
 The team also considered searching for use of patient responses to pain scales as 
 evidence that the clinician evaluated patients’ responses to opioid use. However, 
 pain scales have many uses without concomitant use of opioids and merely evaluating 
 pain is not sufficient to assess risk for opioid-related harms. Therefore, the 
 guidance does not include pain scale evaluation as a method for determining the 
 benefits of opioid use. 
<p>
  
<p>To address the recommendation statement “optimize other therapies and work 
  with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper opioids,” implementers 
  should determine what local activities represent such actions and map the activity 
  to the SNOMED-CT concept: <i>High risk drug monitoring (regime/therapy): SCTID: 268525008</i>
</p>

<p>The project team considered potential benefits of regularly scheduled queries 
to identify the cohort of patients who have been given new prescriptions for
opioids or prescriptions for escalating doses. Further the analysis of the
cohort could also determine those for whom assessment of risk or high-risk 
drug monitoring had not occurred at the expected intervals, triggering a 
task list for a clinician role to be determined by the practice. This 
non-synchronous approach is challenged by the fact that CDS Hooks requires
an event such as opening a record or ordering a mediation as a trigger. 
Since opioid prescriptions have limited number of days supplied,
patients on continued therapy have encounters with physicians; 
therefore, triggering on the entry of a new prescription order allows 
intervention in a synchronous manner and is equally effective to the
asynchronous approach to identify patients requiring evaluation and
monitoring.

<ul>
    <li>
        Value sets provided include concepts from standardized code systems (e.g., SNOMED-CT, ICD-10-CM, RxNorm) to
        indicate inclusion criteria for a given data element. However, clinicians often document using natural language
        and/or local codes. In addition, some sources only capture billing codes. The implementation site must have a
        mechanism to map such clinician-entered data to the content of the value set to determine if a patient's data
        represents the information required for processing the clinical decision support. Vendors and implementation sites
        may use third party vendors and tools to perform such mappings. The result is a need to create the mappings for
        each guideline valueset based on locally available information. To assure consistency of such translations across
        settings and vendor products requires careful study and analysis. The process also requires effort on the part of
        the EHR, local implementation site, or third party vendor; new value sets must be analyzed and individually
        configured in the system, and existing value sets must be updated regularly to support newly available codes, and
        reviewed for accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some concepts seem relatively straigthforward when included in a clinical guideline for consumption by a
        clinician. However, when setting up queries to retrieve data from EHR or other clinical software data storage, the
        concepts needed may be difficult to encode using available code systems. Value sets can help with the problem only in
        so far as the concepts are clearly defined without ambiguity. A good example is the definition of end-stage,
        stage 4 or terminal cancer, for exclusion from opiate usage calculation. One approach is to develop a value set
        indicating metastatic cancer and pancreatic cancer. This has the potential of covering the vast majority of cancers
        and secondary malignant neoplastic disease. Avoiding primary neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease seems prudent
        as these diagnoses are less likely to identify patients for whom the opportunity for additional treatment and
        quality of life has passed. However, successfully identifying patients for whom opiate medications should be ignored
        might better be managed by using encounter location or type to identify patients assigned to hospice care, e.g.
        <ul>
            <li>Procedures
                <ol>
                    <li>Referral to hospice (procedure) SCTID : 306205009</li>

                    <li>Full care by hospice (finding) SCTID: 170935008</li>
                    <li>Transition from self-care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 448451000124101</li>
                    <li>Transition from acute care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 1891000124102</li>

                    <li>Transition from long-term care to hospice (finding) SCTID: 1951000124104</li>

            </li>
            <li>Regime/therapy:
                <ol>
                    <li>Dying care (regime/therapy) SCTID: 385736008</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Because it is so difficult to identify individual patients who are appropriately receiving high opioid doses,
        it is important to allow the physician to override the alert with a reason, e.g., to indicate end-of-life care.
        Since the override option has the potential of over alerting, a mechanism to determine end-of-life care as provided
        using hospice care seem preferable.

<p>This section describes rationale and justification for guideline recommendations that are not currently targeted in this implementation guide.</p>

<a name="scope-rationale-rec01"> </a>
<h3><span class="sectioncount">8.2.4.1</span> Recommendation #1 <a href="process-documentation.html#scope-rationale-rec01" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#1_Nonpharmacologic_therapy" target="_blank">Recommendation #1:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain. 
      Clinicians should consider opioid therapy only if expected benefits for both pain and function are 
      anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. If opioids are used, they should be combined with 
      nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy, as appropriate. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3)</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #1: The recommendation includes a large number of 
  incompletely defined conditions and non-pharmacologic therapy. Creating definitions and specific 
  recommendations for non-pharmacologic therapy (as orderables) will be complex.  Alternatively, 
  on selection of an opioid order, a simple method might merely provide a selectable option linking 
  to a general description of such therapy, but the impact on outcomes would be low.
</p>

<a name="scope-rationale-rec02"> </a>
<h3><span class="sectioncount">8.2.4.2</span> Recommendation #2 <a href="process-documentation.html#scope-rationale-rec02" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#2_Before_starting_opioid_therapy" target="_blank">Recommendation #2:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Before starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should establish treatment 
      goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function, and should consider 
      how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. Clinicians should 
      continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function 
      that outweighs risks to patient safety. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4)</em>.</strong>
</p> 

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #2: EHRs have different mechanisms for enabling treatment goals, 
  ranging from narrative elements of a visit record, structured care plans, or unstructured visit notes. 
  Therefore, determining that a care goal is established is difficult from a standards perspective. 
  Assuring that such goals are realistic is more problematic. Alternatively, on selection of an opioid order, 
  a simple method is to merely provide guidance (or an option to view such guidance).

<h3><span class="sectioncount">8.2.4.3</span> Recommendation #3 <a href="process-documentation.html#scope-rationale-rec03" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#3_Before_starting_and_periodically" target="_blank">Recommendation #3:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Before starting and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss with 
      patients known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy and patient and clinician 
      responsibilities for managing therapy. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3)</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #3: This recommendation might include provision of general 
  guidance about risks. Potentially, if defined with value sets or direct referenced codes, opioid-induced 
  risks might be identified with entry of new conditions on the problem list, or population of the record 
  with new laboratory results. The CDS can alert the provider (synchronously or asynchronously) when 
  such a new risk occurs. The number of potential conditions to address is quite large and challenges 
  are similar to those for Recommendation #1.

<h3><span class="sectioncount">8.2.4.4</span> Recommendation #6 <a href="process-documentation.html#scope-rationale-rec06" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#6_Long_term_opioid_use" target="_blank">Recommendation #6:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used 
      for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate-release 
      opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain 
      severe enough to require opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven 
      days will rarely be needed. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4)</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #6: It may be possible to determine a new prescription 
  with no prior treatment in the last x months. Determining acute from chronic pain as the cause for 
  the prescription may be more problematic. CDS can recommend limiting therapy to three days or less 
  with maximum of seven days and restricting orders to immediate-release opioids. However, determining 
  the lowest effective dose based on the individual patient’s condition and expected duration of pain 
  is not trivial and requires individual physician-patient interaction. For the latter item, it is possible
  to potentially link to the recommendation without trying to define the lowest effective dose by condition.

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#9_Clinicians_should_review" target="_blank">Recommendation #9:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Clinicians should review the patient’s history of controlled substance prescriptions using 
      state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to determine whether the patient is receiving 
      opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put him or her at high risk for overdose. Clinicians 
      should review PDMP data when starting opioid therapy for chronic pain and periodically during opioid 
      therapy for chronic pain, ranging from every prescription to every 3 months. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4)</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #9: This recommendation may be more problematic unless there 
  is a way to define input from a PDMP as structured data similar to that retrieved with a query to an immunization 
  registry – and associate review and recommendations for ordering with such data. The work also assumes the information 
  from the PDMP is incorporated as structured data in the EHR. Challenges to implementation with potential mitigation 
  for future work: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li><p>a.	PDMP data are compilations of dispensed data from pharmacies. Such data includes NDC codes, several of which are
     represented by a single RxNorm ingredient code.  Therefore, data from PDMP require terminology mapping to RxNorm ingredient 
     codes to incorporate into medication ordering workflow pathways.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>b.	Clinical sites generally receive PDMP data in unstructured form, e.g., PDF files. To enable re-use of these data,
     PDMP output requires standardization to meet needs for semantic interoperability and incorporation directly into 
     clinical software workflow.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>c.	Note that calculations regarding maximum daily dose of opioids for clinical decision support may provide different 
    results for “as needed” (PRN) medications based on the method for determining daily dose. CDS calculating the maximum daily 
    dose from dosage multiplied by the maximum frequency provides the largest dose potentially consumed by a patient during any 
    of the days covered by the prescription. CDS calculating the maximum daily dose from number of doses (i.e., supply) divided 
	by the days supplied (days covered by the prescription) may lead to a lesser daily total.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">8.2.4.6</span> Recommendation #12 <a href="process-documentation.html#scope-rationale-rec12" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#12_Clinicians_should_offer_or_arrange" target="_blank">Recommendation #12:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment (usually medication assisted 
      treatment with buprenorphine or methadone in combination with behavioral therapies) for patients 
      with opioid use disorder. <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 2)</em>.</strong>
</p>

<p>Justification for deferring Recommendation #12: Potentially complex for implementation. I suspect this recommendation would 
  require the ability to include a referral order to a clinic or recommendation to use methadone or buprenorphine. But the work 
  may be complicated by what information is available in the EHR with respect to behavioral therapies. Ideally, acknowledgement 
  of the referral and fulfillment (i.e., the patient has been seen and accepted into the program, or is currently receiving one 
  of the therapies from the index physician) would be communicated back to the referring provider and available to the decision support.
