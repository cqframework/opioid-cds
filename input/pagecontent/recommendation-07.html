<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#7_Clinicians_should_evaluate_benefits" target="_blank">Recommendation #7:</a></p>
<p>
    <strong>Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of
    starting opioid therapy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should
    evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or
    more frequently. If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid therapy,
    clinicians should optimize other therapies and work with patients to taper opioids
    to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4)</em>.</strong>

<p style="background-color: gold; border:1px solid maroon; padding: 5px; max-width: 790px;">
    The ranges introduced are based on practical considerations for identifying a course
    of treatment likely to be subject to the recommendation. They were arrived at through
    discussion with pilot partner clinicians.
</p>
<p><strong>Patient is being prescribed opioids for chronic pain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient does not appear to be at end of life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Determine whether patient has been assessed for benefits and harms of opioid therapy in past 90 days.</strong></p>
<h4>Assessment of risk for opioid abuse:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Assessment of risk for opioid abuse (procedure) SCTID: 454281000124100</li>
    <li>High risk drug monitoring (regime/therapy): SCTID: 268525008</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determine whether patient has taken opioid for at least seven of past ten days AND has an encounter in the past 12 months (excluding today)</strong></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>Determine whether patient has taken opioid for at least 21 of past 30 days for the past three months</strong></p>
<p><strong>
    If the patient has not been assessed for opioid risk in past 90 days and has taken opioid in seven of the past ten days
    with an encounter in the past 12 months or has taken opioid in 63 of the past 90 days, provide a recommendation to conduct an opioid therapy risk assessment:
</strong></p>
<p>
    Patients on opioid therapy should be evaluated for benefits and harms
    within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid therapy and every 3 months or more subsequently.
</p>
<p>Provide a suggestion in the form of a Procedure resource populated with one of the risk assessment codes listed above.</p>
<p>In addition, provide links to the CDC Guidance.</p>
<p>One of the following responses should be required:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Will schedule assessment of risk for opioid use.</li>
    <li>Risk of overdose carefully considered and outweighed by benefit; snooze 3 months.</li>
    <li>N/A-see comment (will be reviewed by medical director); snooze 3 months.</li>
</ul>
